I remember it all too well.
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath.
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something about it felt like home somehow.
We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
You belong with me, walking the streets with your worn-out jeans.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street.
It takes everything in me not to call you.
I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
All too well, it was rare, I was there, I remember it.
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it.
The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
We could leave the Christmas lights up until January.
And I don’t know why I dance with you in a storm in my best dress.
You were the best thing that’s ever been mine.
So don't you worry your pretty little mind.
People throw rocks at things that shine.
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm.
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you.
He’s long gone when he's next to me.
You call me up again just to break me like a promise.
This love is good, this love is bad.
This love is alive back from the dead.
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me.
There’s something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained.
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town.
Maybe I asked for too much, maybe this thing was a masterpiece.
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well.
