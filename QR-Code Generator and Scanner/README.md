## Installation

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-qr-code-tool.git
cd enhanced-qr-code-tool

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py
\`\`\`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- qrcode
- Pillow (PIL)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Requests

## Usage

### Generating QR Codes

1. Enter text or URL in the input field
2. Customize your QR code using the available options
3. Click "Generate QR Code"
4. Download the generated QR code using the download button

### Scanning QR Codes

1. Upload a QR code image using the file uploader
2. Select preprocessing methods based on image quality
3. Enable additional detection options if needed
4. View the decoded content and any special formatting

## Tips for Better Scanning

- Ensure the QR code is well-lit and in focus
- Make sure all corners of the QR code are visible
- Try different preprocessing methods for difficult images:
  - Enhance Contrast works well for low-contrast images
  - Threshold works well for clear, high-contrast images
  - Adaptive Threshold works well for unevenly lit images
  - Edge Detection can help with complex backgrounds
